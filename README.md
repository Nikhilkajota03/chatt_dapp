Setting Up and Deploying a Smart Contract with Hardhat

This guide walks you through setting up your development environment for writing and deploying smart contracts using Hardhat. We'll also cover verifying your contract on the Sepolia test network.
Prerequisites

    Node.js (version 14.x or later) - https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
    npm (version 6.x or later) - Included with Node.js installation
    Hardhat installed globally (npm install -g hardhat) - https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started
    An Alchemy account to get an RPC URL - https://www.alchemy.com/
    (Optional) An Etherscan API key to verify your contract - https://etherscan.io/apis

Setting Up Your Local Environment

    Clone Your Project:
    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    cd yourrepository

    Use code with caution.

Install Dependencies:
Bash

npm install

Use code with caution.

    Set Up Environment Variables:

    Create a file named .env in your project's root directory. Paste the following lines into the file, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

    PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
    RPC_URL=https://arb-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your_alchemy_api_key
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS= (leave blank for now)  # This will be filled after deployment
    ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key (optional)

    Important:
        Do not commit your .env file to version control. It contains sensitive information like your private key.

Deploying Your Smart Contract

    Compile the Contract:
    Bash

    npx hardhat compile

    Use code with caution.

This command compiles your Solidity code into bytecode that can be deployed on the blockchain.

Deploy the Contract:
Bash

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network Sepolia

Use code with caution.

    This command will:
        Compile your contract code (already done in step 1)
        Deploy the contract to the Sepolia test network
        Print the deployed contract address. Copy this address for later use.

Verifying Your Contract (Optional)

If you have an Etherscan API key, you can verify your deployed contract on Etherscan for better visibility. The specific steps for verification will depend on the platform you use (e.g., Hardhat plugins).

Note:

    Remember to replace the placeholder values in the environment variables with your own information.
    The CONTRACT_ADDRESS variable should be filled with the actual address after deployment.
